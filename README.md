# Swift Project Creation

This extension allows to create an empty Swift project in VS Code. The necessary `Package.swift` file, a dummy `main.swift` file as well as VS Code-specific workspace files are generated. The user only needs to select a root folder for his workspace and indicate a project name.

The minimal Swift version (`swift-tools-version`) to be used in the `Package.swift` file can be set in the *Settings* (`swift-project-creation.swift.toolsVersion`).

This extension works well with the [Swift for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sswg.swift-lang) extension.

## Installation
You can install this extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cgrevisse.swift-project-creation).

## Usage

* Install the extension and reload VS Code.
* Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and enter `swift`. The autocompletion should suggest the option *Create a Swift Project*.
* Choose a root folder where the Swift project will be created in. A new folder with the necessary files will be created inside.
* Indicate the name of your Swift project.
* The newly created workspace will be opened. Please find the `main.swift` file inside the `Sources` folder.
* Happy Swift-ing :-)
